# Unit 1 - Review of AP Calculus AB: Integration part 1 - Activities

When you have a bar to the right of a function, with "b" on the top and "c" on the bottom, do f(b) - f(c).

*This would be f(b) - f(a) (where x^3/3 = f(x)).*

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Integration): 
Def. Integral from a to b of a function f(x) is the same as g(b) - g(a) where g is the antiderivative of f.  
d/dx of a definite integral from a constant, b to x (a variable) of a function f(t) is just f(x), i.e, the derivative of a definite integral from a constant to x is just f(x).
